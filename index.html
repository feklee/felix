      <em>Felix E. Klee</em> has an academic background in
      architecture
      and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0375960106014617">physics</a>.
      He is exploring tropical regions for opportunities to realize
      living architecture with strangler figs, something that is not
      possible in his home country Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      The prime example of this type of architecture are
      the <a href="images/living-root-bridge.jpg">living root
      bridges</a> in Meghalaya, which Felix visited and
      <a href="images/sketch.jpg">documented</a> in November 2022 and
      July 2023.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Fab23, in July 2023, Felix’ conference
      paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8171646">Living
      Architecture: Making at Architectural Scale</a> was selected as
      one of three featured papers.  It was presented during
      the <a href="https://youtu.be/mvoHkYrI8ww?t=331">morning
      talks</a> on Fab23 education day.  Two days later, Felix ran the
      workshop
      <a href="images/fab23-workshop.jpg">Architecture With Living
      Trees</a> where we looked at
      a <a href="images/fab23-site.jpg">site</a> in Gelephu.
    </p>

    <p>
      In April and Mai 2023, Felix was resident at DreamSpace Academy
      where he was running a living
      architecture <a href="https://web.facebook.com/dreamspace.academy/videos/198472246294775/">program</a>.
      The goal is to inspire the next generation to study about
      nature, to advance engineering, and to experience construction
      at architectural scale.  With living architecture, we don’t need
      to worry about harming the environment with massive experiments.
      Our waste is regenerative.
    </p>

    <p>
      After returning from visiting
      the <a href="images/tongliang.jpg">Tongliang Great Banyan</a> in
      February 2023, Felix initiated the ongoing
      series <a href="https://www.dimsumlabs.com/bamboo-banyans-hacking-nature-for-architecture-2023-02-21/">Bamboo
      & Banyans</a> at Dim Sum Labs hacker space.
    </p>

    <p>
      When in Meghalaya for the living root bridges in November 2022,
      he gained practical experience when helping with construction of
      the <a href="https://themeghalayan.com/living-root-bridge-moving-to-city/">Living
      Root Pavilion</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In July 2022, as part of the digital naturalism conference
      Dinacon in Sri Lanka, Felix ran the
      workshop <a href="https://www.2022.dinacon.org/2022/09/15/fighouse/">Fig,
      Ficus, Fighouse!</a>.  Together with conference participants and
      students, a tetrahedral structure was erected out of bamboo and
      populated with ficus cuttings obtained from trees nearby.
    </p>

    <p>
      Just weeks before, on the other side of the world, a similar
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtnFzfWDCq72tfIYek9-VLqAAg-55erZe1BZz6Cq3Ks">workshop</a>
      was held at Lancetilla, the national botanical garden of
      Honduras.  In collaboration with Soroush Garivani and
      Jean-Nicolas Dackiw, Felix introduced garden management to
      strangler fig based construction. A platform was set up to
      evaluate the growth of these trees in the local subtropical
      climate. Based on the outcome of the experiments, we will plan a
      living structure with utility to the garden and its visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2020, Felix conducted
      <a href="https://wiki.dimsumlabs.com/Pink-Grow-Lab">experiments</a>
      about growing vines into shapes at Dim Sum Labs Hong Kong.  In
      the jungle atop Victoria Peak, he set up
      a <a href="sound-installation">sound installation</a> together
      with noise artist 3x3x3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Felix’ work with living plants stems from interest in structures
      that organically adapt to their environment.  He created SAN,
      the <em>Self Aware Network</em>, which could be experienced in
      a <a href="https://sonarhongkong.com/en/2019/artists/workshop-san-self-aware-network">workshop</a>
      at Sónar Hong Kong 2019.  For deTour 2019, he scaled up SAN to
      an
      interactive <a href="https://www.detour.hk/2019/self-aware-network/">sound
      sculpture</a>, composed of coconuts and
      bamboo.  <a href="https://github.com/feklee/a-to-m">a-to-m</a>,
      a toy based on SAN, won
      the <a href="https://awrd.com/en/award/game-design-challenge-learning/result">first
      prize</a> in the 2020 Innovative Game Design Challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adaptive structures were predated by his collaborative
      architecture initiative.  Participants from all over the
      Internet guide the positioning of blocks to build a structure in
      the real world.  As underlying technology, Felix developed
      the <a href="https://www.realitybuilder.com/">Reality
      Builder</a>.  The interactive
      installation <a href="images/wir-bauen.jpg">Wir Bauen</a>, made
      of wooden blocks, was set up at Chaos Communication Camp 2015.
      A byproduct of thinking about reconfigurable structures is the
      <a href="images/blocktoy.png">BlockToy</a> series of
      architectural models.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Spektrum Berlin, Felix
      curated <a href="https://spektrumberlin.org/communities/metamatter/past-events.html">MetaMatter</a>,
      a laboratory of research and practice focused on the
      transformations of matter.  With Eitan Rieger, he created the
      interactive light
      sculpture <a href="images/time-portal.jpg">Time Portal</a>, part
      of HGN collection.  They founded Rieger & Klee GbR, a Berlin
      based art production company.
