      <em>Felix E. Klee</em> has an academic background in
      architecture and physics.  He is exploring tropical regions for
      opportunities to construct with strangler figs beyond the living
      root bridges, something that is not possible in his home country
      Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      In July 2022, as part of the digital naturalism conference
      Dinacon in Sri Lanka, he ran the
      workshop <a href="https://www.2022.dinacon.org/2022/09/15/fighouse/">Fig,
      Ficus, Fighouse!</a> at Dreamspace Academy. Together with
      conference participants and students, a tetrahedral structure
      was erected out of bamboo and populated with ficus cuttings
      obtained from trees nearby.

      Just weeks before, on the other side of the world, a similar
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtnFzfWDCq72tfIYek9-VLqAAg-55erZe1BZz6Cq3Ks">workshop</a>
      was held at Lancetilla, the national botanical garden of
      Honduras. In collaboration with Soroush Garivani and
      Jean-Nicolas Dackiw, Felix introduced garden management to
      strangler fig based construction. A platform was set up to
      evaluate the growth of these trees in the local subtropical
      climate. Based on the outcome of the experiments, we will plan a
      living structure with utility to the garden and its visitors.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2020, Felix conducted
      <a href="https://wiki.dimsumlabs.com/Pink-Grow-Lab">experiments</a>
      about growing vines into shapes at Dim Sum Labs Hong Kong.  In
      the jungle atop Victoria Peak, he set up
      a <a href="sound-installation">sound installation</a> together
      with noise artist 3x3x3.
    </p>

    <p>
      Felix’ work with living plants stems from interest in structures
      that organically adapt to their environment.  He created SAN,
      the <em>Self Aware Network</em>, which could be experienced in
      a <a href="https://sonarhongkong.com/en/2019/artists/workshop-san-self-aware-network">workshop</a>
      at Sónar Hong Kong 2019.  For deTour 2019, he scaled up SAN to
      an
      interactive <a href="https://www.detour.hk/2019/self-aware-network/">sound
      sculpture</a>, composed of coconuts and
      bamboo.  <a href="https://github.com/feklee/a-to-m">a-to-m</a>,
      a toy based on SAN, won
      the <a href="https://awrd.com/en/award/game-design-challenge-learning/result">first
      prize</a> in the 2020 Innovative Game Design Challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Adaptive structures were predated by his collaborative
      architecture initiative.  Participants from all over the
      Internet guide the positioning of blocks to build a structure in
      the real world.  As underlying technology, Felix developed
      the <a href="https://www.realitybuilder.com/">Reality
      Builder</a>.  The interactive
      installation <a href="images/wir-bauen.jpg">Wir Bauen</a>, made
      of wooden blocks, was set up at Chaos Communication Camp 2015.
      A byproduct of thinking about reconfigurable structures is the
      <a href="images/blocktoy.png">BlockToy</a> series of
      architectural models.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Spektrum Berlin, Felix
      curated <a href="https://spektrumberlin.org/communities/metamatter/past-events.html">MetaMatter</a>,
      a laboratory of research and practice focused on the
      transformations of matter.  With Eitan Rieger, he created the
      interactive light
      sculpture <a href="images/time-portal.jpg">Time Portal</a>, part
      of HGN collection.  They operate Rieger & Klee GbR, a Berlin
      based art production company.
