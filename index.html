      <em>Felix E. Klee</em> has an academic background in
      architecture and physics.  He is exploring tropical regions for
      opportunities to construct with strangler figs beyond the living
      root bridges, something that is not possible in his home country
      Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2020 he conducted
      <a href="https://wiki.dimsumlabs.com/Pink-Grow-Lab">experiments</a>
      about growing vines into shapes at Dim Sum Labs Hong Kong.  In
      the jungle atop Victoria Peak, he set up
      a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKJCbRw-KMQ">sound
      installation</a> together with noise artist 3x3x3.
    </p>

    <p>
      His work with living plants stems from his interest in
      structures that organically adapt to their environment.  He
      created SAN, the <em>Self Aware Network</em>, which could be
      experienced in
      a <a href="https://sonarhongkong.com/en/2019/artists/workshop-san-self-aware-network">workshop</a>
      at Sónar Hong Kong 2019.  For deTour 2019, he scaled up SAN to
      an
      interactive <a href="https://www.detour.hk/2019/self-aware-network/">sound
      sculpture</a> composed of coconuts and
      bamboo.  <a href="https://github.com/feklee/a-to-m">a-to-m</a>,
      a toy based on SAN, won
      the <a href="https://awrd.com/en/award/game-design-challenge-learning/result">first
      price</a> in the 2020 Innovative Game Design Challenge.
    </p>

    <p>
      Felix’ work on adaptive architecture was predated by work with
      collaborative architecture.  In a joint effort, participants
      from all over the Internet guide the erection of a structure,
      thereby connecting the real and the virtual.  As underlying
      technology, Felix developed
      the <a href="https://www.realitybuilder.com/">Reality
      Builder</a>.  The interactive
      installation <a href="images/wir-bauen.jpg">Wir Bauen</a>, made
      of wooden blocks, was set up at Chaos Communication Camp 2015.
      A byproduct of thinking about reconfigurable structures, is the
      <a href="images/blocktoy.png">BlockToy</a> series of
      architectural models.
    </p>

    <p>
      At Spektrum Berlin, Felix
      curated <a href="https://spektrumberlin.org/communities/metamatter/past-events.html">MetaMatter</a>,
      a laboratory of research and practice focused on the
      transformations of matter.  He is partner in the art production
      company Rieger & Klee GbR, creator of the light
      sculpture <a href="https://www.rieger.design/timeportal">Time
      Portal</a>, part of the HGN collection.
